## Introduction
Many data science students and scholars are stuck with the models they built and have no way of making it available for use to everyday people because the skills for deploying these models are rarely taught in most machine learning courses.

In this project, I used AWS SageMaker to Deploy an LSTM-based Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews. Created a simple web application where a user can enter a review and get back a response showing if their review or comments are either negative or negative.
I explained the steps taken to achieve this result.
